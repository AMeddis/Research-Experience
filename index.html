I am currently an Assistant Professor of Biostatistic in the Univeristy of Copenhagen, Denmark. 
I work at the Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, where I arrived for my postdoc. 
I started my career as a researcher at the Institute Curie, Paris, France during a 6 months exchange for the Master thesis,
and I successively started my PhD on survival analysis with a focus on clustered data, such as meta-analysis and multicentric 
data in the field of breast cancer. As for now, my research primarly includes applied and theoretical methodology for longitudinal 
and time-to-event data, causal inference and targeted learning in observational studies. 
Moreover, my recent work also focuses on quantile estimaton for time-to-event data in meta-analysis and pseudo-values observations. 
Many projects are based on the danish registry data or randomized clinical trials. 
I collaborate with medical doctors and epidemiologist for a wide range of projects and I provide statistical support 
for a group of PhD and master medical students in the Infectious disease department in Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark.
